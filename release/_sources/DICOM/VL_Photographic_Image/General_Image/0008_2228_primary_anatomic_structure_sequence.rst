Primary Anatomic Structure Sequence (0008,2228)
===============================================

For orthodontic photographs, the primary anatomic structure for extraoral views is designated as *Face Structure (body structure)*. In contrast, intraoral views exhibit a broader range of variations, as enumerated in the following table.
