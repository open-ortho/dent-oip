Burned in Annotation (0028,0301)
================================

According to DICOM, burned in annotation indicates whether or not image
contains sufficient burned in annotation to identify the patient and
date the image was acquired. If this Attribute is absent, then the image
may or may not contain burned in annotation.

For orthodontic purposes, conventionally photographs do not contain any
burned in annotations. If this were the case for your software, this
value could always be present and set to NO.
