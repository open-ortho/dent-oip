Study Description (0008,1030)
=============================

This is an optional DICOM tag, which can contain a Long String (64
character max), part of the General Study module. For the application of orthodontic photographs, Study Description is used to replicate the treatment progress, as defined in :ref:`Acquisition Context Sequence<acquisition_context_sequence>`.

The Study Description is shown by most PACS system in the search results when listing studies after a query. It is therefore recommended to repeat the information contained in the Concept Codes described above also here. When doing so, keep in mind that the medical provider might need to use this field as well, and only 64 characters are allowed here.

Study Description Examples
