Concept Name Code Sequence Attribute (0040,A043)
------------------------------------------------

.. note:: 
  The Concept Name for CID-91 entries is defined in `TID 3460 Projection Radiography Acquisition Context <https://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/chtml/part16/chapter_c.html>`__ to be `DCM-130324 Functional condition present during acquisition <https://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/chtml/part16/chapter_D.html#DCM_130324>`__.

Concept Code Sequence Attribute (0040,A168)
-------------------------------------------

The following are those codes of `DICOM CID 91 <http://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/chtml/part16/sect_CID_91.html>`__ which are of interest to orthodontic photography.

.. warning:: 
  I'm not sure about the correctness of these codes: in CID 91, the SNOMED-CT codes used in CID 91 are observable entities, qualifier values or procedures. Here there are findings and record artifacts.
