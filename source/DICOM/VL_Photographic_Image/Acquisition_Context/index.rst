Acquisition Context
===================

This normative section contains a description of the DICOM tags relevant to orthodontic photography pertaining to the Acquisition Context module.

For orthodontic photography, we make use of the `Acquisition Context Module <https://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/chtml/part03/sect_C.7.6.14.html>`__ to store the treatment progress, the conditions of the lips and mouth (open, closed, smiling, relaxed, etc), the occlusal relationship (centric occlusion, centric relation), the acquisition view and the image view.
