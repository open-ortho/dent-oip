Acquisition Context
===================

This normative section contains a description of the DICOM tags relevant to
orthodontic photography pertaining to the Acquisition Context module.

During an orthodontic treatment, it is common for the provider to keep
track of treatment progress by regularly collecting records (such as
photographs or intra-oral surface scans) [provide reference]. It is
therefore useful to identify when, relative to an orthodontic treatment,
the records were taken. 

For orthodontic photography, we make use of the `Acquisition Context Module <https://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/chtml/part03/sect_C.7.6.14.html>`__ to store the treatment progress, the conditions of the lips and mouth (open, closed, smiling, relaxed, etc), occlusal relationship (centric occlusion, centric relation), acquisition view and image view.
