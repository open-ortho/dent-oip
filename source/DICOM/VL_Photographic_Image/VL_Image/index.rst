VL Image
===================

This normative section contains a description of the DICOM tags relevant to orthodontic photography pertaining to the VL Image module.

For orthodontic photography, we make use of the `VL Image Module <https://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/chtml/part03/sect_C.8.12.html#table_C.8-77>`__ to store the conditions of the patient during the photographic acquisition session (lips and mouth open, closed, smiling, relaxed, etc), the occlusal relationship (centric occlusion, centric relation, see :ref:`definitions`), the Image View (projection) and the Image View Modifier (direct or indirect).
