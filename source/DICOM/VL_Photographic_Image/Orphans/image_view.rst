Dental Image Views
==================

Photographs in orthodontics are not always taken directly: sometimes there is a
device between the patient and the camera lens, like a mirror, to be able to see
specific regions.

* Direct: traditional photograph, nothing between lens and anatomy.
* Indirect: ?? Needs Explanation TODO: Explain Indirect
* Mirror: light from anatomy is reflected on a mirror before reaching camera lens.
