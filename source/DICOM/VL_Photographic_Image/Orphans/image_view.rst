    It appears as if this is a duplicate for :ref:`device sequence`. This needs to be verified. Is it possible that we no longer need this?

Photographs in orthodontics are not always taken directly: sometimes there is a
device between the patient and the camera lens, like a mirror, to be able to see
specific regions.
