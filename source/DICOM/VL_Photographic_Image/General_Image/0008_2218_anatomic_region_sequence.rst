Anatomic Region Sequence (0008,2218)
====================================

According to DICOM, this sequence identifies the anatomic region of interest, i.e., external anatomy, surface anatomy, or general region of the body. Only a single Item is permitted in this Sequence.

When applied to orthodontic photographs, the anatomic region is always

* *Structure of head and/or neck (body structure)*

This code was selected, because it is the most detailed code that includes ear as well: the ear is present in both frontal and lateral extra oral views.

Refer to the :ref:`List of Codes <list_of_codes>` in the Appendix for the correct SNOMED codes to use.
