Quality Control Image (0028,0300)
===========================================


Indicates whether or not this image is a quality control or phantom image. In the orthodontic practice, a quality control image is usually an image that the staff take of themselves or of other objects to ensure that the equipment is functioning as desired, or to test new settings (flash, exposure, ...) on the camera. Under these circumstances, it is important the this tag is set to ``YES``.

For regular production use of images of patients, this value should always be set to ``NO``.
