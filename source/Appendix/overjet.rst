Overjet

Quoting from Draker H. L., Handicapping Labio-Lingual Deviations: A Proposed Index for Public Health Purposes, American Journal of Orthodontics, (pp295-305), April 1960.


    Overjet in millimeters is recorded with the patient in the centric occlusion and measured using a ruler from the labial of the lower incisor to the labial of the upper incisor. The measurement could apply to a protruding single tooth as well as to the whole arch. The measurement is read and rounded off to the nearest millimeter. 


Overjet in DICOM
****************

Overjet is a clinical diagnosis and requires clinical interpretation and therefore is not stored in the original DICOM image object. However, in order to properly measure Overjet, a measuring device such as a millimeter ruler is required in the image itself and should be recorded accordingly. See :ref:`DICOM Device Sequence <device sequence>` for details.
