A device used to prevent soft tissue of the oral cavity from appearing in the field of view. The device is typically flat and comes in different shapes, in order to be placed in the oral cavity behind the teeth to be photographed. The device is also used to keep other soft tissue like cheeks from covering areas of interest, thus serving a dual purpose: retractor and background. 

Any of the intraoral views can be taken with a contraster.
