Use Cases for Orthodontic Images
=================================================


ADA Technical Report No. 1065 for Use Cases of the Orthodontic Electronic Health Record contains use cases that describe orthodontic workflows, both imaging and non-imaging. Within 1065, Use Case No. 03 specifically addresses the creation of digital orthodontic records, which includes the imaging workflows. ADA Standard No. 1100 "Dentistry - 2D and 3D Orthodontic/Craniofacial/Forensic Photographic Views and Viewsets" is specific for visible light images.

Please refer to the original ADA documents for more details on each use case.


ADA TR 1065 Use Case No. 03 - Creating Digital Orthodontic Records
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

This use case outlines both direct and indirect workflows for creating digital orthodontic records, either through direct capture with imaging devices or by digitizing analog records. It details how acquired images and models are tagged with standard metadata and integrated into the patientâ€™s EHR for proper storage and retrieval. The process supports efficient transformation between digital and analog formats for clinical applications such as 3D printing. 


.. note::
   The following use cases are based on ADA Standard No. 1100 and may be outdated. Please refer to the latest release of ADA1100 for the most current information.

ADA 1100 Use Case No. 2.1 - Routine Orthodontic Photography Workflow
---------------------------------------------------------------------

    """
    A routine set of facial and intraoral photographs is ordered by the
    practitioner. A suitable view set is chosen in the practitioner's software
    application. The practitioner and photographer may not be the same person.
    The software prompts the specifications of each photograph in sequence and
    the photographer acquires and uploads each image by means of a conventional
    camera or mobile phone. The software labels the image and creates the
    desired view set out of the individual images.
    """

ADA 1100 Use Case No. 2.2 - Referral and Image Transfer Workflow
------------------------------------------------------------------

    """
    The practitioner orders a referral of the patient to a colleague for
    evaluation and selects clinically relevant information including certain
    extraoral and intraoral photographs in the electronic health record. The
    referring practitioner's software manages the transmission of the
    information and the individual photographs labelled with the naming codes
    described in this white paper. The receiving computer in the colleague's
    office accepts the photographs and files the transmitted photographs into an
    alternate view set preferred by the colleague. Thus, the colleague's
    software receives photographs identical to those present in the referring
    office but presents them in a different display without the need for a human
    to view the individual files and sort them.
