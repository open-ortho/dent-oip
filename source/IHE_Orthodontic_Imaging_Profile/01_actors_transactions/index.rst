Actors/Transactions
===================

Acquisition Modality
--------------------

A system that acquires and creates medical images while a patient is present. A modality may also create other evidence objects such as Grayscale Softcopy Presentation States for the consistent viewing of images or Evidence Documents containing measurements, etc. In orthodontic care, modalities acquire diagnostic information such as images and/or evidence documents. Some examples of these may include still visible light photography, visible light motion picture with audio, radiographs, etc.


Acquisition Modality Importer
-------------------------------

A system that interfaces to a non-DICOM ready modality in order to integrate that modality into dental care workflows.

Department System Scheduler/Order Filler
----------------------------------------

A department-based system that provides functions related to the management of orders received from external systems or through the department system's user interface. A dental or orthodontic example of a department based system could be a dental Practice Management System (PMS).
