Scope
=====

The intended audience of this document is the medical imaging software developers or medical imaging device manufacturer who deals with visible light digital photography.

The scope of this document is to alleviate the work of the imaging software developer or device manufacturer, allowing him or her to spend more time focussing on their idea, and less time designing and implementing novel and proprietary ways for connecting with other products. That work is alreay done and defined. All that needs to be done is implement it in your product.

The document, along with its accompanying CSV files and DICOM sample files, 
provide a detailed implementation guide for encoding orthodontic/craniofacial
views using DICOM with SNOMED CT terminology.


This guide depends on ADA SCDI White Paper 1100 -
Orthodontic/Craniofacial/Forensic Photographic Views and Viewsets available online on the ADA Catalog.
