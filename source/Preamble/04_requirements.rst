Requirements
============

In ADA SCDI WP-1100, the orthodontic providers have identified the following functionality as being essential or crucial for providing maximum patient care and research capabilities.

- ensure that the devices used are capable of distinguishing each individual kind of photograph unambiguously
- ensure that any device that wasn't used to initially tag or identify the image is capable of recognizing the image the same way that the original device intended to.
- Ensure the following characteristics of the photographs are indexable separately:
    - Patient demographics
    - Side of patient (left, right, frontal, ...)
    - Anatomy being images (whole face, part of face, mouth)
    - ...

In order to fulfill these requirements, a standard that unambiguously defines how orthodontic photographic images should be electronically represented has been written. 

- The standard makes use of DICOM, allowing any developer to implement it.
- The standard defines a way to tag the image with all required elements.
- The tagging of the images is done making use of a standardized code set (SNOMED-CT), to ensure no ambiguity exists.
