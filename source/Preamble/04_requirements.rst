Requirements (Informative)
==========================

This document was developed to fulfill all requirements specified in **ADA Standard 1100 Functional Profiles for Orthodontic Photography** by the orthodontic community thus setting a standard methodology that clearly defines how orthodontic photographic images should be electronically represented:

1. **Using DICOM**: 
   - DICOM provides the industry with the ability to develop solutions that store and recall images and their metadata across different products.

2. **Improving Search Capabilities**: 
   - Using DICOM tags allows the industry to develop solutions that enhance search capabilities by searching through DICOM tags and their values.

3. **Acquisition Process**: 
   - Demonstrating or aiding the staff member during the acquisition process is part of the user experience of the software they are using and is not covered in this document. The choice of standards utilized here (DICOM and SNOMED-CT) will not impede the industryâ€™s ability to provide such solutions.

5. **Implementation Benefits**: 
   - By implementing this standard, the industry can develop products that capture and store all necessary information, eliminating the need for custom implementations.

6. **Persistence**: 
   - Persistence is a key characteristic of DICOM and SNOMED-CT.

7. **DICOM Protocol**: 
   - DICOM has a defined protocol for exchanging images over networks and between devices. Promoting DICOM use facilitates implementation, and increased adoption by developers enhances interoperability. SNOMED-CT ensures consistent interpretation across different devices and software.

8. **DICOM Tags**: 
   - All characteristics listed in sections 9-18 can be recorded in DICOM tags and are addressed in this document.
