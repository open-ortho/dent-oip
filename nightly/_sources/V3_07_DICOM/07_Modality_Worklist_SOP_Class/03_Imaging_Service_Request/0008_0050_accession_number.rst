Accession Number (0008,0050)
============================

Recommended. The system SHALL use the Accession Number attribute to associate this image instance with an appointment or encounter during which this image was acquired.

The accession number should be a number that is generated by the system which generates the request to acquire specific images. In the workflow of an orthodontic practice, this would typically be done by the practice management system. Examples for what to use could be:

- The ID of the request for performing a procedure.
- The ID of the appointment during which it would be expected to acquire this image. 
- Although not ideal, in some cases where Modality Worklists are not used, the ID of the encounter during which this image was acquired may also be used.
