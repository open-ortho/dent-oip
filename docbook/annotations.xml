    <title>Burned in Annotation (0028,0301)</title>

    <para>According to DICOM, burned in annotation indicates whether or not
    image contains sufficient burned in annotation to identify the patient and
    date the image was acquired. If this Attribute is absent, then the image
    may or may not contain burned in annotation.</para>

    <para>For orthodontic purposes, conventionally photographs do not contain
    any burned in annotations. If this were the case for your software, this
    value could always be present and set to NO.</para>
