  <title>Progress</title>

  <para>During an orthodontic treatment, it is common for the provider to keep
  track of treatment progress by regularly collecting records (such as
  photographs or intra-oral surface scans) [provide reference]. It is
  therefore useful to identify when, relative to an orthodontic treatment, the
  records were taken. Examples could be:</para>

        <td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><para>type</para></td>

        <td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><para>description</para></td>

      </tr>
    </thead>

    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><para>Pre-treatment <emphasis

      </tr>

      <tr>

        <td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><para>Records taken the moment treatment
        was completed.</para></td>

        <td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><para/></td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><para>Post-treatment <emphasis

        <td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><para>Records taken after treatment was

        <td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><para/></td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </informaltable>

  <para>Where <emphasis role="italics">n</emphasis> is a serial number or
  letter indicating the sequence order. For example, "Pre-treatment 1" would
  refer to records taken temporally before "Pre-treatment 3". And the
  existence of "Pre-treatment 3" indicates that other two sets of records
  where take for this patient.</para>

          <listitem>
            <para>Study Description is often visible from many PACS search
            results. The provider can therefore quickly identify which
            progress the entry refers to. This is a weak pro, because nothing
            prevents orthodontic specific software to show this information,
            were it stored elsewhere.</para>

            Actually, this could be an incentive for vendors to develop more
            orthodontic specific DICOM software, and for orthodontic providers
            to support and request them.</para>
