  <title>Lossy Image Compression</title>

  <para>According to <link

  DICOM </link> : <blockquote>
      <para>The Attribute Lossy Image Compression (0028,2110) conveys that the
      Image has undergone lossy compression. It provides a means to record
      that the Image has been compressed (at a point in its lifetime) with a
      lossy algorithm and changes have been introduced into the pixel data.
      Once the value has been set to "01", it shall not be reset.</para>

      <para>Note</para>

      <para>If an image is compressed with a lossy algorithm, the Attribute
      Lossy Image Compression (0028,2110) is set to "01". Subsequently, if the
      image is decompressed and transferred in uncompressed format, this
      Attribute value remains "01". The value of Lossy Image Compression
      (0028,2110) in SOP Instances containing multiple frames in which one or
      more of the frames have undergone lossy compression shall be
      "01".</para>
    </blockquote></para>

  <para>For orthodontic purposes, this tag should be used, because of the
  varied nature of photographic capture equipment. Some cameras are configured
  to store images in raw and uncompressed format, others will save a
  compressed JPEG image. In order to correctly encode this information, the
  following three DICOM tags should be used.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Lossy Image Compression Attribute (0028,2110)</title>

    <para>Set to the string <code>"00"</code> if image is not compressed.
    Otherwise set to the string <code>"01"</code>.</para>

    <para>In order to know if an image is to be considered compressed or not,
    one needs to be familiar with the algorithm used to store the
    image.</para>
